download the 2D images from the [KITTI website](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=2d) (left color images)

place the images and labels in `image_2` and `label_2`

I provide the train/val split (`train.txt` and `val.txt`) used in the paper.

the script will find corresponding images and annotations for training and validation automatically.
